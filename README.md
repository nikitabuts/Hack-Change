# Hack-Change
Data Science Track
Stack: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn), Yandex API
A team of 4 people solved the problem on real data of X5 Retail Group
to predict the optimal average number of packages to pick up
from cashboxes and postamats. 30 teams took part in the hackathon.
I created a predictive model, analyzed data, and also was a
manager in the team.
